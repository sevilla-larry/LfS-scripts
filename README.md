# Creating/using scripts instead of manually encoding all lines
#
# These scripts assumed you finished executing up to Chapter 4.
#
# For Chapter 5 & 6, the user should be "lfs" and the location should be "/mnt/lfs/sources" directory.
# that means the prompt should be:
# lfs:/mnt/lfs/sources$
#
# For Chapter 7 & up, the user should be "root", should CHROOT, the the location should be "/sources" directory.
# that means the prompt should be:
# root:/sources#
#
# copy the script files ( *.sh ) in the said directory
#
