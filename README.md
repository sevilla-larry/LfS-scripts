# Creating/using scripts instead of manually encoding all lines
#
# These scripts assumed you finished executing up to Chapter 4
# and the location is "/mnt/lfs/sources directory".
# The user for chapter 5 & 6 is "lfs", while for Chapter 7 up is "root"
#
# that means the prompt should be:
# lfs:/mnt/lfs/sources$ - for Chapter 5 & 6
# or
# lfs:/mnt/lfs/sources# - for Chapter 7 up
#
# copy the script files ( *.sh ) in the said directory
#
